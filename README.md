# Logic Gateway component

! This is a privileged component and is meant to be running globally. !

## What are Logic Gateways?
In combination with the Orchestrator, Logic gateways provide means for conditional flow execution.
Logic Gateways support a simple set of instructions and operations, that can also be nested in order to create more complex scenarios. This set is called a `rule`. The Logic Gateway processes the rule and can directly apply data emitted by previous nodes of the same flow to decide which node should be executed next. 
 

## Supported operations

This list will be gradually expanded.

### Operation types
* `CONDITION` - see conditionals and operations below
* `BRANCHING` - see branching

### Conditionals
* `AND`
* `OR`

### Operations

* `CONTAINS`
* `EQUALS`
* `IS_TRUTHY` - Check if a given string|object is truthy (not null, 0 or undefined)

### Branching
* `SWITCH` - Execute the first truthy branch
* `SPLIT` - Execute all branches
* `JOIN_ONE_OF`- Proceed if at least one of the branches was truthy
* `JOIN` - Wait for all branches to have executed

### Commands

-- Commands are passed directly to orchestrator, thus not uppercase as above. Work in progress --

* `void` - the orchestrator does nothing and awaits further commands
* `abort`
* `finish`
* `start-flow` â€“ `parameters` should contain flowId:stepId
* `run-next`
* `run-next-steps`  - `parameters` should contain flowId:stepId

## How it works

1. Add this component as a step in a flow 
2. Define a logic instruction, and add it as `rule` to the `fields` object of current flow node
3. The orchestrator recognizes a logic gateway component and sends a special (privileged) token to it
4. Logic gateway fetches data for all steps of a current flow from the Snapshot Repository and applies the given logic instruction to it. (!) In order for this to work, affected flow nodes/components must post their snapshot explicitly to Snapshot Repository. This can be done by settings the `nodeSettings.autoSaveSnapshots` property in flow nodes. In the future, the orchestrator shall recognize if a flow contains a logic gateway and if so, then automatically send the output data of a flow step to Snapshot Repository with a `flowExecId`. 
5. Each logic instruction can have a `positive` and `negative` outcome `actions` defined.


## Special cases

### Looping
Check if a condition is met and if `negative`, then instruct the orchestrator via `start-flow` and `parameters` which previous step should be repeated.

### Waiting for a specific result/condition
Logic Gateway can emit a `void` to orchestrator, indicating that it should `idle` and do nothing. This may be useful if there are multiple incomming edges and the Logic Gateways should only allow execution of the next node when a rule condition is met.

An example of a snapshot data used for the two examples above

```js
{
  data: [
    {
      flowId: 123,
      flowExecId: 7,
      stepId: 0,
      snapshot: {
        username: 'hello@example.com',
        firstname: 'HellO',
      },
    },
    {
      flowId: 123,
      flowExecId: 7,
      stepId: 1,
      snapshot: {
        username: 'hello@example.com',
        firstname: 'HellO',
        tenant: {
          name: 'Example Inc.',
        },
      },
    },
    {
      flowId: 123,
      flowExecId: 7,
      stepId: 2,
      snapshot: {
        username: 'hello@example.com',
        firstname: 'HellO',
        tenant: {
          name: 'Example Inc.',
          zip: 55779,
        },
      },
    },
  ],
